# Instagram Data Analysis Project

## Project Description
Welcome to the Instagram Data Analysis project, where we leverage SQL skills to extract meaningful insights from the data to help make informed decisions about the future direction of one of the world's most popular social media platforms. As a data analyst working with the product team at Instagram, the role involves analyzing user interactions and engagement with the Instagram app to provide valuable insights that can help the business grow. The insights derived from this analysis can be used by various teams within the business, such as the marketing team, product team, and development team.

## SQL Tasks

### Marketing Analysis
1. **Loyal User Reward**: Identify the oldest users on Instagram.
2. **Inactive User Engagement**: Identify users who have never posted a single photo on Instagram.
3. **Contest Winner Declaration**: Determine the winner of the contest and provide their details to the team.
4. **Hashtag Research**: Identify and suggest the top five most commonly used hashtags on the platform.
5. **Ad Campaign Launch**: Determine the day of the week when most users register on Instagram. Provide insights on when to schedule an ad campaign.

### Investor Metrics
1. **User Engagement**: Calculate the average number of posts per user on Instagram. Also, provide the total number of photos on Instagram divided by the total number of users.
2. **Bots & Fake Accounts**: Identify users (potential bots) who have liked every single photo on the site, as this is not typically possible for a normal user.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to use SQL and MySQL Work as your tool to analyze Instagram user data and answer questions posed by the management team. Your findings could potentially influence the future development of the app.
